## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-26

- Renamed repository from `thetadx` to `ThetaDataDx`
- Switched license to GPL-3.0-or-later
- Added disclaimer, legal considerations, and EU interoperability section
- README updated with GitHub callouts (NOTE, TIP, IMPORTANT, WARNING, CAUTION)
- Fixed PyPI package description (was empty — added readme field to pyproject.toml)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added

- **DirectClient** for MDDS gRPC — 19 typed endpoints for historical market data
  (stock/option/index: list, history, snapshot, at-time, greeks)
- **FpssClient** for FPSS streaming — real-time quotes, trades, open interest, OHLC
  via TLS/TCP with heartbeat and manual reconnection
- **Auth module** — Nexus API authentication (email/password → session UUID)
- **FIT/FIE codec** — nibble-based tick compression/decompression (ported from Java)
- **Greeks calculator** — full Black-Scholes: 22 Greeks + IV bisection solver with
  precomputed shared intermediates and edge-case guards (t=0, v=0)
- **All tick types** — TradeTick, QuoteTick, OhlcTick, EodTick, OpenInterestTick,
  SnapshotTradeTick, TradeQuoteTick with fixed-point Price encoding
- **80+ DataType enum codes** — quotes, trades, OHLC, all Greek orders, dividends,
  splits, fundamentals
- **Proto definitions** — extracted via runtime FileDescriptor reflection from
  ThetaData Terminal v202603181 (endpoints.proto + v3_endpoints.proto)
- **Runtime configuration** — `DirectConfig` with all JVM-equivalent tuning knobs
- `contract_lookup(id)` on `FpssClient` for single-entry hot-path lookup
- `FpssEvent::Error` variant for surfacing protocol parse failures
- Date parameter validation on all `DirectClient` methods
- `async-zstd` feature flag for optional streaming decompression
- **Python SDK** (PyO3/maturin) — wraps the Rust crate, not a reimplementation
- **Go SDK** — CGo FFI bindings over the C ABI layer
- **C++ SDK** — RAII C++ wrapper over the C header
- **C FFI crate** (`thetadatadx-ffi`) — stable `extern "C"` ABI for all SDKs
- **Documentation** — architecture (Mermaid), API reference, reverse-engineering guide, JVM deviations
- **CI/CD** — GitHub Actions (fmt, clippy, test, FFI build, crates.io publish, PyPI publish, GitHub Release)
- **Project infrastructure** — CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, CODE_OF_CONDUCT,
  clippy.toml, cliff.toml, rust-toolchain.toml, LICENSE (GPL-3.0-or-later)

### Security

- Credential `Debug` redaction — passwords never appear in debug output
- `AuthRequest` does not derive `Debug` (prevents password in error traces)
- Session UUID redaction — bearer tokens logged at `debug!` level only, first 8 chars
- `assert!` on FPSS frame size limits — enforced in release builds
- Unified TLS via rustls for all connections (MDDS gRPC + FPSS TCP + Nexus HTTP)
- Timeouts on all network operations (auth 10s/5s, gRPC keepalive, FPSS connect, FPSS read 10s)
- 7 credential/account errors treated as permanent disconnect (no futile reconnect loops)
- Contract root length validated before wire serialization
- FIT decoder uses i64 accumulator with i32 saturation (no silent overflow)
- Price type range enforced with `assert!` in release builds
