//! Async wake-up signal for the pull-iter delivery path.
//!
//! Bridges the Disruptor consumer thread (Rust-side, holds no event-loop
//! reference) to an asyncio / select-loop reader (Python / external code,
//! waiting on a file descriptor). The bridge is one-directional: every
//! time the consumer pushes an event into the iterator queue and the
//! caller has registered a wake FD, a single byte is written so the
//! reader's `epoll` / `kqueue` / `select` wake fires.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Built on a self-pipe (POSIX `pipe2(O_CLOEXEC | O_NONBLOCK)`) so it
//! works under every POSIX event loop today — Python asyncio
//! `loop.add_reader(fd)`, C `poll`, Tcl, etc. Linux `eventfd` is a tighter
//! fit (single 8-byte counter, no buffer pressure) but adds a Linux-only
//! code path. The self-pipe approach is portable across macOS, Linux, and
//! BSD without losing the "single wake per non-empty transition" semantic
//! we actually care about.
//!
//! # Coalescing
//!
//! A naïve "write one byte per push" would flood a small pipe (default
//! 64 KiB on Linux) under load and back-pressure the consumer thread on
//! `write`. To avoid that, every [`WakeFd`] carries a `signaled`
//! `AtomicBool`: the producer only writes when it observes the bool was
//! `false`, after which it sets the bool to `true`. The reader is
//! responsible for clearing the bool **before** it drains the pipe so the
//! next producer push re-arms the wake — see [`WakeFd::rearm`].
//!
//! Ordering: the producer sets `signaled` to `true` and then writes the
//! byte. The reader clears `signaled` to `false` and then drains the
//! pipe. The two orderings together guarantee that any push observed
//! AFTER the reader cleared `signaled` will write a fresh byte the reader
//! will see on its next `epoll` wait. The race in which the reader
//! clears the bool while a push is mid-write is benign — the byte the
//! producer wrote is still in the pipe, and the reader's drain will
//! consume it.
//!
//! # Disposal
//!
//! The owning [`super::EventIterator`] holds an `Arc<WakeFd>` and the
//! consumer closure (via the pull-iter `Delivery::Queue` variant)
//! holds another `Arc<WakeFd>` clone. The write-end FD is closed inside
//! [`WakeFd::drop`] when the refcount hits zero — i.e., after both the
//! iterator and the consumer closure have been dropped. The read-end
//! FD is the caller's responsibility; the SDK never owns it.
